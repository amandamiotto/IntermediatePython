## File parsing
### Parsing common file formats (e.g., csv, xml)
### Parsing less common, biomechanics-specific, formats (sto, trc, mot)
### Parse almost anything


This class assumes you have a basic grasp of Python, and/or have completed and understood the Software Carpentry Python classes. If you would like to learn this, but have not completed the classes or would like a revision, please contact your friendly hacky hour crew at Griffith on hackyhour@griffith.edu.au or reach out to your local hacky hour or software carpentry group.

### Python 2 vs Python 3

### Different IDE's

### File Parsing

At times, you will have formats that you need to change for your work. We will focus today firstly on two common ones (csv and xml), then look further into bio-mechanic specific formats. Hopefully by the end of this lesson, you will have a grasp of how to change any file.

We are going to step through code on how to do this- HOWEVER never forget about the magical powers of google. There are an incredible amount of functions and code people have written and published via github or other places that can save you time. Never be afraid to recycle code- but always take the time to understand what that code does.

#### Now lets convert to Python
